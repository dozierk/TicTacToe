    //This is the file where all AI implementation is handled. Initially a start with satisfying all required functions and protocols and each of the variables. Didn't have much time to go further with this part, but there's plenty of potential code. Ran into a hangup when trying to have the AI class conform to NSObject, GKGameModel, GKGameModelPlayer, and GKGameModelUpdate. My thoughts were to then remove the protocols and created extensions. Instead creating classes to separate the model logic to house data required to function and actually implement movement logic in the Move class. In the future, will work on GKGameModel implement and having the AI class conform to that protocol. Should make the code a bit cleaner and concise.
